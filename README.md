## Overview

#### We're taked to modify Dana's webpage to allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we will add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results

#### The below code allows us to add 5 filters that our site users could use to narrow down their search criteria

This is what the filters look like on our site. Users could type in text for any of the five criteria:

Below is an example of what we see when we filter by City:"el cajon"

## Summary

#### A drawback of this design is that the user typed criteria would have to match the values in our data table. So a user has to get the spelling exactly correct and would some how have to know the exact range of dates that are available in our table. A better idea wwould be to have a drop down menu for each filter criteria rather than a text input field.
